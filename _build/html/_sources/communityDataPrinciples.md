# ASP Community Data Principles

Guiding data principles have been developed with the intention to promote best practice and support the underlying design and functionality of the metadata catalogue. The principles cover what data providers should consider when evaluating what attributes of their data need to be formatted and described now, and how this might influence the utility of their data in future.  

The principles are not intended to be prescriptive, and acknowledge that Antarctic data are multidisciplinary and disparate, which could make the application of these principles inappropriate for some data.
